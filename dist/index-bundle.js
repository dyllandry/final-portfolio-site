Build to Expectations\nPrior to an experience, *everyone* has expectations. Rarely, if ever, do people approach a situation with virtually no prejudice, predictions, or desire for specific outcomes. It\'s an evolutionarily advantageous trait to be *expecting*; to predict the tiger or expect an ally\'s aid.\n\nMeeting someone\'s expectations can reduce total cognitive load. For example, if what I thought before still holds true now, then there\'s no readjustment to make.\n\nAnd in the opposite, there\'s something to be said about *not* meeting someone\'s expectations; to purposely trigger some effort on the user\'s end to understand what they\'re seeing.\n\nIn order to either meet or reject the user\'s expectations, use what they have arrived at your site to do as a starting block. Write down what job they are trying to complete, or what information they may be looking for.\n\nAs a user experience designer yourself, whether you meet or reject the user\'s expectations is up to you, and neither decision is right or wrong. For example, does your portfolio site meet people\'s expectation of what information they are hunting for, or does it surprise them with a novel experience that gets them thinking?\n\n## 2. Build Less to Build More\nSubstance can only be defined in relation to a lack of substance. For example, someone can only be big when in comparison to someone small. Without the small person, the big person is no longer big.\n\nFor a website, it can only contain convincing content if clear boundaries have been set as to what is *not* there. That is, a site may only seem simple if there is a clear distinction of what separates it from other more complex sites.\n\nIt is on this basis, the idea that you can only have substance by contrasting with a lack thereof, that I believe *less is more*. In other words, I think that you can only have more by first showing less.\n\nIf the idea I propose is hard to think about, find reassurance that Steve Jobs agrees with you.\n\n> "Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it\'s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."<span class="quote-attribution">— Steve Jobs</span>\n\n## 3. Ever Form Follows Function\nSince starting a design from scratch can be difficult, here is a starting point I find helpful.\n\nA device\'s form should follow its function. That is, the device\'s function should come first, and its form should be based on that function. *Ever form follows function*.\n\nThe act of design itself is shaping forms for particular functions.

That is, if some feature doesn't serve its purpose well enough, I'll become unhappy with it and usually change or remove it.\n\nHowever, I am proud to say that I am happy with my portfolio site. I've taken many steps to ensure it delivers on what benefits I think are important.\n\n## Benefits\n### Self Serve Buffet\nAt a buffet, getting your food is easy. You're probably starving, you've finally got your table, the only thing you need is a clear path to the food and not too many suprises along the way.\n\nThis website is a lot like a buffet. You probably know what your looking for, it's easy to see what's available, and the path to those resources is clear. It's not flashy, but you aren't looking for something flashy. You're looking for substance.\n\n### You're Not Excluded\nImagine being denied access to a resource because of something outside your control. Take for example your age, race, or sex. In this case, my example is visual impairment.\n\nThat this site has been rigorously designed for multiple levels of accessiblity is not a matter of statistics (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/blindness/GLOBALDATAFINALforweb.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"The W.H.O. 2010 report on visual impairments.\">roughly 4% of the world's population is visually impaired</a>) but instead of principle and compassion.\n\nTo make sure everyone has equal access to this site, I've designed the navigation menus to adhere to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menubar/menubar-1/menubar-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" arial-label=\"How to make a navigation menubar as prescribed by the W3C organization.\">interaction and structure standards</a> set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). \n\nParticular html structures and attributes are required to ensure assistive technologies can properly understand the webpage. Similarly, JavaScript must lend a hand in order to facilitate the necessary interaction patterns assistive technologies employ.\n\n### There's Room to Grow\nAs a web developer I am always improving. How I believe my site should work, or what benefits I think it should provide, will definitely change as time goes on.\n\nThe homepage layout of this site is purposefuly built using a tile layout provided by the <a href=\"https://bulma.io/documentation/layout/tiles/\" target=\"_blank\">Bulma CSS framework</a>. And like tiles, it can be made to fit any arrangement. This site affords easily adding or removing pieces.\n\n#### Easy to Add Posts\nOriginally, adding more posts to the site was tedious. For each addition, Webpack's config files had to be reconfigured. Multiple files had to be created, some mostly blank, in order to support Webpack's features.\n\nAfter finishing an early version of the site and developing a better understanding of how Webpack works, I decided to improve the workflow of adding more posts. Now, additional posts are automatically detected and added to the site, all with very little work required of the end user.\n\n##### Technical Workflow Description\n\nConsidering the constraints of Webpack and the <a href=\"https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">html webpack plugin</a> I was using, I built a small build pipeline that runs prior to Webpack's configuration.\n\nThis build pipeline will search a `./posts/` directory for any markdown files. Given any found markdown file, the pipeline will immediately build the markdown's respective html file and updated Webpack's configuration file to know of it.\n\nWhereas Webpack's configuration file previosuly had to be modified by hand, it was now automated.\n\nMy new build pipeline makes adding additional posts a breeze. This project's GitHub repository's <a href=\"https://github.com/dyllandry/final-portfolio-site/blob/master/readme.md\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Dylan's portfolio project GitHub repository's read-me file.\">readme.md file</a> details the process.\n\nHowever, I did have to give up a feature of Webpack that I had previously thought was too good to lose.\n\nWebpack, given awareness of the file, can reload itself whenever the file changes, otherwise known as hot reloading. This allows your development environment to always be up to date with your source files.\n\nHowever, hot reloading requires that Webpack be aware of the original source file. Given that my previous build pipeline exports the markdown as html on its own, weback is only aware of the passed html.\n\nTherefore changing the markdown does not trigger Webpack to reload. Instead, for Webpack to serve the new file once a change has been made, the entire Webpack development server must be restarted.\n\nWhile this is a cost, I think it is a cost which is out weighed by the ease-of-use benefit the new build pipeline offers.\n\nAnd a solution is not far off. It would not be difficult to start my own hot reload process that runs adjacent to Webpack. As long as the markdown is re-exported to html, Webpack will notice the changed html and trigger a reload.\n\n## Things to Improve\nI'd like to acknowledge what I could do better with this site. Because I believe it is okay to be ignorant, especially if you are aware of it.\n\n> \"There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don't know we don't know.\"<span class=\"quote-attribution\">— Donald Rumsfeld</span>\n\n### Simplicity is Difficult\nA focus of my site is to deliver information as efficiently as I can on the home page. There are three sections: about me, featured work, and my blog, which I think deliver the majority of what visitors would be looking for.\n\nThough, to adhere to people's navigational expectations of how a site should work, I implemented a navigation bar across the top of the site. When on the home page, these links just highlight the sections already present.\n\nMy effort was to simplify the visitor's experience by condensing most desired information into just the home page. However, in tandem with adhearing to a common navigation pattern that is in this case unnecessary, the result may be an experience that is actually convoluted for some. \n\nLike Steve Jobs said, \"Simple can be harder than complex.\"\n\nThis site will continue to improve as I receive more feedback from users. Maybe the navigation bar will remain, or possibly it will be removed. Or something else will take its place entirely.\n\n## Conclusion\nOverall I am happy with my portfolio site. One of the important factors for my experience as its maintainer is the site's room for growth. If I eventually think of a way it should change, I won't feel constricted by the systems already in place.\n\nFurthermore, should I complete a new project, or write development tutorial, or choose to share my ideas on various topics, this site can easily facilitate the addition of new pages.\n\nAnd yes, it's true, many of these features come packaged with pre-existing static site builders. \n\nAlthough, this is all for the sake of learning, and now I know first hand some of the necessary mechanisms for those systems to operate.

This project is important to me because the  mason involved is my very own father. My father is an extraordinary mason with over 30 years of experience. I had to make sure that people see his work properly for how great it is.\n\nHere is a link to the <a href="https://www.whitehorsemasonry.com" target="_blank">White Horse Masonry webpage</a> and another to the <a href="https://github.com/dyllandry/white-horse-masonry-services" target="_blank">project\'s GitHub repository</a>.\n\n<figure class=\'image is-2by1\' style="margin: 50px 0px;">\n  <img class=\'post-image\' data-src=\'whms-2by1.png\' alt="The White Horse Masonry homepage which immediately features large images of their amazing work."/>\n</figure>\n\n## Design\nWhen people visit a mason\'s website, their first thought will be to imagine the mason\'s work in front of their own home or business. This website was designed to afford that process by putting the mason\'s work up front and center. \n\nThe visitor\'s *second* thought will be to consider this mason\'s work against the competition. This site\'s layout enables the work to speak for itself.\n\n<figure class=\'image is-4by3\' style="margin: 50px 0px;">\n  <img class=\'post-image\' data-src=\'whms-gallery-4by3.png\' alt="The White Horse Masonry website gallery full of exclusively images of their amazing work."/>\n</figure>\n\n## Benefits\n### Always in touch\nAssuming our client is interested, contacting White Horse Masonry (WHM) is always a clear and available action; Fixed to the top of every page is the company\'s phone number. Additionally on the home page is the company\'s email as well as a contact form.\n### No Delays\nValue diminishes over time. Whether it\'s a candy bar, a preordered Tesla, or ten dollars, we would always like it *now* rather than *later*. \n\nHowever, an image heavy site can take long to load. To remedy this issue, while the visitor waits for high resolution photos, low resolution images will take their place. When the higher resolution photo loads, the low resolution image is replaced.\n\n<figure class=\'image is-4by3\' style="margin: 50px 0px;">\n  <img class=\'post-image\' data-src=\'lazy-fuzzy-load-4by3.png\' alt="The White Horse Masonry website gallery first quickly loaded with low resolution photos, then replaced by higher resolution images."/>\n</figure>\n\n## Available to All Clients\nWhether visitors are using their ultra widescreen desktops, old phones, their Apple watches, or iPads, the website is always presented as well as possible.\n\n<figure class=\'image is-4by3\' style="margin: 50px 0px;">\n  <img class=\'post-image\' data-src=\'collage-4by3.png\' alt="The White Horse Masonry website is presented well across all device sizes."/>\n</figure>\n\n## Implementation\n### Webpack\n\n<figure class=\'image is-128x128 is-pulled-right\'>\n  <img class=\'post-image\' data-src=\'webpack-logo.png\' alt="The White Horse Masonry website gallery first quickly loaded with low resolution photos, then replaced by higher resolution images."/>\n</figure>\n\nThe WHM site could be static. That is, built from source files to a final distributed site. Whenever the site\'s content changes, either more photos added or the layout changed, the site must be rebuilt.\n\n<a href="https://webpack.js.org" target="_blank">Webpack</a>, formally described as a module bundler, can facilitate the build process. Webpack is so powerful in part because it affords other developers a standard file input/output process for them to build plugins according to.\n\nTwo Webpack plugins I employed were particularly helpful.\n- <a href="https://github.com/herrstucki/responsive-loader" target="_blank">Responsive loader</a>: Exports source images in multiple resolutions to better fit devices and reduce load times on slow networks. \n- <a href="https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin" target="_blank">Html Webpack Plugin</a>: Responsible for bundling all processed resources into the final html files.\n\nFurther more, since a static site\'s output is only a set  files, the site is extremely easy to host. In this case, <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> provided free hosting.\n\n### Image Gallery\nThe WHM image gallery is a critical component of their online presentation, and it was important that I got it right. That said, when you want something done right, *don\'t do it yourself*, and instead use another\'s developer\'s pre-packaged solution.\n\n<a href="https://masonry.desandro.com" target="_blank">Masonry</a> is a widely used JavaScript grid layout library. Even <a href="http://iam.beyonce.com/tagged/my_work" target="_blank">Beyoncé</a> uses Masonry. If Masonry is good enough for Beyoncé, it\'s probably good enough for me.\n\n<a href="https://photoswipe.com" target="_blank">PhotoSwipe</a> is a full screen viewer for photos. That is, you press on a photo, it grows to fit your screen, and provides a few extra controls like zooming in, moving horizontally between photos, and sharing links.\n\n\n<figure class=\'image is-2by1\' style="margin: 50px 0px;">\n  <img class=\'post-image\' data-src=\'photoswipe.png\' alt="The White Horse Masonry website image gallery lets visitors get a closer look by providing a fullscreen  image viewer for browsing through photos one at a time."/>\n</figure>\n\n## The Costs\nI\'d like to acknowledge what I\'ve done poorly with this site. Because I believe it is okay to be ignorant, especially if you are aware of it.\n\n> "There are known knowns; there are things we know we know.

But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don\'t know we don\'t know."<span class="quote-attribution">— Donald Rumsfeld</span>\n\n### Tedious to Update\nI had two weeks to create this site. Leveraging the paternal relationship between the client and I, I\'ve assumed they will contact me pesonally whenever content should be added to the site.\n\nIn retrospect, and assuming the potential absence of this paternal relationship, I would instead provide a content management system (CMS), like <a href="https://keystonejs.com" target="_blank">Keystone</a>, for the client to add their own images.\n\nHowever, given the static build process already implemented, a server would be required to host the Keystone instance. Keystone can be configured to upload photos to Amazon Web Services (AWS) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Simple Storage Service</a> (S3). Then, maybe, a webhook could trigger Webpack rebuilds that would pull images from the same AWS S3 source and then push to the GitHub pages repository to finally update the site. I\'d probably investigate that further.\n\nBut there might be simpler ways...\n\n"Static site CMS" in Google revealed some simpler solutions like <a href="https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. So yes, there are simpler ways. Always research the unknown unknowns! 😅\n\n### Development Time\nA simple static site should not take two weeks to develop. Though, I do lend myself some slack since figuring out Webpack in that capacity took some time.\n\nTo speed up my development pace I would...\n- Use a CSS framework. I\'m definitely capable of producing custom and complex CSS, but in review that was not necessary for this website.\n- Finalize a rough design before programming. Programming is used to implement a designed solution or feature. If it isn\'t yet designed than it\'s experimenting, and experimentation may not be what you want to spend your time doing, and your spare time redoing.\n\n## Conclusion\nEven though I\'d like to add more to the site, after all a project is never done, I am happy with what I\'ve made. Some parts are thrown together, but It manages to look nice and work well.\n\nI think I made the important parts good, and the secondary parts okay, and the tertiary parts managable. Right now I really can\'t ask for more than that.',html:'<h1>White Horse Masonry Services</h1>\n<p>This was my first freelance website, a front-facing collection of work for a masonry company.

Though, I do lend myself some slack since figuring out Webpack in that capacity took some time.</p>\n<p>To speed up my development pace I would...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a CSS framework. I\'m definitely capable of producing custom and complex CSS, but in review that was not necessary for this website.</li>\n<li>Finalize a rough design before programming. Programming is used to implement a designed solution or feature. If it isn\'t yet designed than it\'s experimenting, and experimentation may not be what you want to spend your time doing, and your spare time redoing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Even though I\'d like to add more to the site, after all a project is never done, I am happy with what I\'ve made. Some parts are thrown together, but It manages to look nice and work well.</p>\n<p>I think I made the important parts good, and the secondary parts okay, and the tertiary parts managable. Right now I really can\'t ask for more than that.</p>\n',attributes:{title:"White Horse Masonry Services",description:"Letting the work of a master mason speak for itself.
