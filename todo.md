# Todo
- Highlight section title on nav press instead of outlining
- on mobile, turn post media element image into a float-left so the paragraph can wrap around it?
- Add resume link?
- Blog post section for non featured/work stuff.
    - For this I'll definitely need a better markdown adder
    - Precompile paths to markdown files and insert them as entry points?
- Implement manually ordering featured posts
- remove thumbnail from yaml in readme, unnecessary.
