- Production: fouc
  - fouc related? blog post jumps in
    - fade in? Hide whole site before blogpost?
- BUNDLE SIZE
  - icons are biggest things on index (70kb each)
  - manually declare size for thumbnail images? (is loading 600px wide version for 100px wide slot)
- simplify adding blog post process
  - But... Having an entry for each blogpost would allow for unique javascript per page..
    - a blogpost js file could EXTEND (or something) a base one.
- check ... operator
- are required resources in posts being required multiple times?
