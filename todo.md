# Todo
- Write second post (this website itself)
- hamburgering from post to menu should 0 opacity the post so it is not visible when the menu shuts.
- fade in index page (why not, everything else does. better consistancy)
- remove thumbnail from yaml in readme, unnecessary.
- Blog post section for non featured/work stuff.
