<p>I&#39;ve restarted my portfolio site a dozen times. Then I decided to name the site&#39;s Github repository <a href="https://github.com/dyllandry/final-portfolio-site" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to Dylan Landry's portfolio site's Github repository."><em>final-portolio-site</em></a> and see through it to the end.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>I can become unhappy with features I&#39;ve designed. Because I approach design from a functional perspective. That is, if some feature doesn&#39;t serve its purpose well enough, I&#39;ll become unhappy with it and usually change or remove it.</p>
<p>However, I am proud to say that I am happy with my portfolio site. I&#39;ve taken many steps to ensure it delivers on what benefits I think are important.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<h3 id="self-serve-buffet">Self Serve Buffet</h3>
<p>At a buffet, getting your food is easy. You&#39;re probably starving, you&#39;ve finally got your table, the only thing you need is a clear path to the food and not too many suprises along the way.</p>
<p>This website is a lot like a buffet. You probably know what your looking for, it&#39;s easy to see what&#39;s available, and the path to those resources is clear. It&#39;s not flashy, but you aren&#39;t looking for something flashy. You&#39;re looking for substance.</p>
<h3 id="youre-not-excluded">You&#39;re Not Excluded</h3>
<p>Imagine being denied access to a resource because of something outside your control. Take for example your age, race, or sex. In this case, my example is visual impairment.</p>
<p>That this site has been rigorously designed for multiple levels of accessiblity is not a matter of statistics (<a href="https://www.who.int/blindness/GLOBALDATAFINALforweb.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="The W.H.O. 2010 report on visual impairments.">roughly 4% of the world&#39;s population is visually impaired</a>) but instead of principle and compassion.</p>
<p>To make sure everyone has equal access to this site, I&#39;ve designed the navigation menus to adhere to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menubar/menubar-1/menubar-1.html" target="_blank" arial-label="How to make a navigation menubar as prescribed by the W3C organization.">interaction and structure standards</a> set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </p>
<p>Particular html structures and attributes are required to ensure assistive technologies can properly understand the webpage. Similarly, JavaScript must lend a hand in order to facilitate the necessary interaction patterns assistive technologies employ.</p>
<h3 id="theres-room-to-grow">There&#39;s Room to Grow</h3>
<p>As a web developer I am always improving. How I believe my site should work, or what benefits I think it should provide, will definitely change as time goes on.</p>
<p>The homepage layout of this site is purposefuly built using a tile layout provided by the <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/layout/tiles/" target="_blank">Bulma CSS framework</a>. And like tiles, it can be made to fit any arrangement. This site affords easily adding or removing pieces.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-improve">Things to Improve</h2>
<p>I&#39;d like to acknowledge what I could do better with this site. Because I believe it is okay to be ignorant, especially if you are aware of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns ‚Äî the ones we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t know.&quot;<span class="quote-attribution">‚Äî Donald Rumsfeld</span></p>

<h3 id="an-easier-markdown-workflow">An Easier Markdown Workflow</h3>
<p>If a site&#39;s main substance is content like written blog posts, then adding additional blog posts should be easy. For this website, markdown files are processed into webpages by <a href="https://webpack.js.org" target="_blank">Webpack</a>, a module bundler.</p>
<p>Webpack introduces a particular workflow. To recieve Webpack&#39;s benefits, you must adhere your project to this workflow. Though, of course, you can be creative. </p>
<p>The problem is that I am still learning what Webpack is capable of. The available documentation well describes how to write functionality within Webpack, for example how to directly use its features.</p>
<p>Though, I am still figuring out how to write my code <em>around</em> Webpack. That is, how can I structure and build my project to augment Webpack&#39;s existant capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="technically">Technically</h4>
<p>Technically what I am doing is pairing each markdown file with its own JavaScript file. Then, from my Webpack config file, I am listing each JavaScript file as its own entry point so that Webpack will process it.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to slim that down and leave Webpack to find the markdown paths on its own. Though, for my <a href="https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin" target_="blank">html webpack plugin</a> to emit an html page, it requires a unique Webpack entry.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still working out a better process. Though, I have put this problem on hold as right now as the current situation is &quot;<em>good enough</em>&quot;. There are other things that I can work on which provide more benefit to both myself and the end user. For example improving the site&#39;s content.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll update this post as soon as I find a better way. I believe I&#39;ll likely figure it out by working on entirely other projects that approach this problem space from other perspectives. Until then, Ciao. üëãüèº</p>
