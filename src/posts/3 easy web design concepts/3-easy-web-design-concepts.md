# 3 Easy Web Design Concepts
By my short opinion, here are three easy design concepts that are readily applicable to the web.

In case you'd like credibility that my opinions have *some* merit, I have a bachelor of arts in <a href="https://umaine.edu/newmedia/" target="_blank" aria-label="The University of Maine New Media program website.">New Media</a>, a minor in <a href="http://catalog.umaine.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=70&poid=9697&returnto=2354" target="_blank" aria-label="The university of maine Human Computer Interaction course page.">Human Computer Interaction</a>, and worked 3 years as a UX designer and junior web developer during university at the <a href="https://umaine.edu" target="_blank" aria-label="The University of Maine Website">University of Maine, Orono</a>.

## 1. Build to Expectations
Prior to an experience, *everyone* has expectations. Rarely, if ever, do people approach a situation with virtually no prejudice, predictions, or desire for specific outcomes. It's an evolutionarily advantageous trait to be *expecting*; to predict the tiger or expect an ally's aid.

Meeting someone's expectations can reduce total cognitive load. For example, if what I thought before still holds true now, then there's no readjustment to make.

And in the opposite, there's something to be said about *not* meeting someone's expectations; to purposely trigger some effort on the user's end to understand what they're seeing.

In order to either meet or reject the user's expectations, use what they have arrived at your site to do as a starting block. Write down what job they are trying to complete, or what information they may be looking for.

As a user experience designer yourself, whether you meet or reject the user's expectations is up to you, and neither decision is right or wrong. For example, does your portfolio site meet people's expectation of what information they are hunting for, or does it surprise them with a novel experience that gets them thinking?

## 2. Build Less to Build More
Substance can only be defined in relation to a lack of substance. For example, someone can only be big when in comparison to someone small. Without the small person, the big person is no longer big.

For a website, it can only contain convincing content if clear boundaries have been set as to what is *not* there. That is, a site may only seem simple if there is a clear distinction of what separates it from other more complex sites.

It is on this basis, the idea that you can only have substance by contrasting with a lack thereof, that I believe *less is more*. In other words, I think that you can only have more by first showing less.

If the idea I propose is hard to think about, find reassurance that Steve Jobs agrees with you.

## 3. Ever Form Follows Function
Since starting a design from scratch can be difficult, here is a starting point I find helpful.

A device's form should follow its function. That is, the device's function should come first, and its form should be based on that function. *Ever form follows function*.

The act of design itself is shaping forms for particular functions. In my opinion, if its form has not been shaped for a function, it is has not been designed.

Given the common web site's purpose, to be a vehicle for specific resources, let the site's information shape its form. Think of how a news story's content could have shaped the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank" aria-label="The New York Times' website.">New York Times' layout</a>, and how photography albums may have shaped <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank" aria-label="The Unsplash website.">Unsplash's layout</a>.

A usually unexpected example: The operations we use today for building web pages follow the web's original function, publishing academic documents. Features like block, inline, and floating layouts exist because they were tools made for formatting and printing academic documents.
