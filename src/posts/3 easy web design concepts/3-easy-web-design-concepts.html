<p>By my short opinion, here are three easy design concepts that are readily applicable to the web.</p>
<p>In case you&#39;d like credibility that my opinions have <em>some</em> merit, I have a bachelor of arts in <a href="https://umaine.edu/newmedia/" target="_blank" aria-label="The University of Maine New Media program website.">New Media</a>, a minor in <a href="http://catalog.umaine.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=70&poid=9697&returnto=2354" target="_blank" aria-label="The university of maine Human Computer Interaction course page.">Human Computer Interaction</a>, and worked 3 years as a UX designer and junior web developer during university at the <a href="https://umaine.edu" target="_blank" aria-label="The University of Maine Website">University of Maine, Orono</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-build-to-expectations">1. Build to Expectations</h2>
<p>Prior to an experience, <em>everyone</em> has expectations. Rarely, if ever, do people approach a situation with virtually no prejudice, predictions, or desire for specific outcomes. It&#39;s an evolutionarily advantageous trait to be <em>expecting</em>; to predict the tiger or expect an ally&#39;s aid.</p>
<p>Meeting someone&#39;s expectations can reduce total cognitive load. For example, if what I thought before still holds true now, then there&#39;s no readjustment to make.</p>
<p>And in the opposite, there&#39;s something to be said about <em>not</em> meeting someone&#39;s expectations; to purposely trigger some effort on the user&#39;s end to understand what they&#39;re seeing.</p>
<p>In order to either meet or reject the user&#39;s expectations, use what they have arrived at your site to do as a starting block. Write down what job they are trying to complete, or what information they may be looking for.</p>
<p>As a user experience designer yourself, whether you meet or reject the user&#39;s expectations is up to you, and neither decision is right or wrong. For example, does your portfolio site meet people&#39;s expectation of what information they are hunting for, or does it surprise them with a novel experience that gets them thinking?</p>
<h2 id="2-build-less-to-build-more">2. Build Less to Build More</h2>
<p>Substance can only be defined in relation to a lack of substance. For example, someone can only be big when in comparison to someone small. Without the small person, the big person is no longer big.</p>
<p>For a website, it can only contain convincing content if clear boundaries have been set as to what is <em>not</em> there. That is, a site may only seem simple if there is a clear distinction of what separates it from other more complex sites.</p>
<p>It is on this basis, the idea that you can only have substance by contrasting with a lack thereof, that I believe <em>less is more</em>. In other words, I think that you can only have more by first showing less.</p>
<p>If the idea I propose is hard to think about, find reassurance that Steve Jobs agrees with you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it&#39;s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.&quot;<span class="quote-attribution">‚Äî Steve Jobs</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-ever-form-follows-function">3. Ever Form Follows Function</h2>
<p>Since starting a design from scratch can be difficult, here is a starting point I find helpful.</p>
<p>A device&#39;s form should follow its function. That is, the device&#39;s function should come first, and its form should be based on that function. <em>Ever form follows function</em>.</p>
<p>The act of design itself is shaping forms for particular functions. In my opinion, if its form has not been shaped for a function, it is has not been designed.</p>
<p>Given the common web site&#39;s purpose, to be a vehicle for specific resources, let the site&#39;s information shape its form. Think of how a news story&#39;s content could have shaped the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank" aria-label="The New York Times' website.">New York Times&#39; layout</a>, and how photography albums may have shaped <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank" aria-label="The Unsplash website.">Unsplash&#39;s layout</a>.</p>
<p>A usually unexpected example: The operations we use today for building web pages follow the web&#39;s original function, publishing academic documents. Features like block, inline, and floating layouts exist because they were tools made for formatting and printing academic documents.</p>
